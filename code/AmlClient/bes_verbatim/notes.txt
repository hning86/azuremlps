batch run outputs (today, 5/25):
model
trained
evaluation

each output has field "RelativeLocation", example:
    "trained": {
      "ConnectionString": "azure storage connection string",
      "RelativeLocation": "mycontainer/trainedresults.csv"
    }

change names of outputs:

evaluation -> performance
status -> setup

"GlobalParameters" define the inputs:
    "Total workers": "",
    "Worker ID": "",
    "Training path": "",
    "Scan proportion": "",
    "Minimum F1": ""


	From webservice goto endpoints:

A training run will be dependent on the experiment version.
Version is currently tracked in AML Experiment via "Etag" which
